51. Modeling Language Files | Namespace
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
what is in the Domain model file
	An object oriented language for defining the domain model for the business network
	Domain Model has
		- Participants
		- Assets
		- Transactions
		- Events
	Written as CTO files
	Namespace cannot be repeated across files
	File naming convention: namespace.cto
	
	namespace org.hyperledger.composer.system
		- Contains base definitions of resources
		abstract -> base resource classes
		
	QZ-21:
	Modeling language is used for ____________
	Namespace is a reserved word that is _______ across multiple model files
	The extension for the model file name is _________
	All of the modelling component MUST be defined in a single file
	Model defines the representation of ___________
		
52. Defining the Resources
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	Resouce: https://github.com/acloudfan/HLF-Course-Domain-Model/tree/master/airlinev1
	
	Usage of IdentifiedBy.
	Primitive Types:
		
		String - A UTF8 encoded stringf
		Double - A double precision 64 bit numeric value
		Integer - A 32 bit signed whole number
		Long - A 64 bit signed whole number
		DateTime - An ISO-8601 compatible time instance
		Boolean - True or False
	
	Enumeration:
		User defined type, enum keywords used for enum
		
	By default calue for all field is Required
	Keyword (Optional)
	Keyword (default)
	
	QZ-22:
	All resources in the network application must have  __________   ____________
	asset  and participant  are ______ in modeling language
	All assets  and participants  defined in the model file should have a field that is used to provide unique identity to each asset/participant instance
	Field used with identified by  should be a String
	Which one is not supported by modeling language?
	Modeling language supports creation of user define type _____
	By default value for the model field is ____________
	Value may be assigned to field as part of the model definition using the ___________

53. Support for Object Orientation:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Resource: https://github.com/acloudfan/HLF-Course-Domain-Model/tree/master/airlinev2

Extend will work in 
	asset -> assset
	participant -> participant
	
It does not support multiple inhertance

Concept
	Generic classes
	does nio represent resource
	
	QZ-23:
	A resource marked as abstract _____ be instantiated; can be _____ to create new resource definitions
	To inherit from a existing resource one has to use the keyword
	Which ONE is valid? asset StockCertificate identified by ID{ ...... }
	Modeling language does not support multiple inheritance
	You may group fields in a modeling construct known as ________
	Concepts, like other resources can be instantiated
	Concepts can be marked abstract
	
54. MODELLING ARRAYS:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Resource: https://github.com/acloudfan/HLF-Course-Domain-Model/tree/master/airlinev3

	- You may declare an array using the square bracket notation like many other languages.

55. Registries & Relationship between Resources:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Resource Registries
Import resources
Relationship
Resource: https://github.com/acloudfan/HLF-Course-Domain-Model/tree/master/airlinev4

	QZ-24:
	You are tasked to model a system to manage a set of assets that can be owned by a set of trusted parties in a business network. There are 3 fixed types of assets, to model these fixed types you would use an
	The model you are designing will have participants, each participant can have an ownership of 0 or more assets. To model this aspect, you would use:
	In your model there is a need to determine who owns the asset. What type of field would you add to the asset such that owner of the asset instance can be found:
	Instances of an asset created in the hyperledger fabric are managed in a ___________
	Relationship is created using the symbol:
	You have modeled two types of Assets: Stock  Bond  You would like to manage the ownership as a relation in these so you created the relationship in AssetOwner  resource to Stock . Would you be able to use the relationship to point to an asset of type Bond  ?
	To access resources defined in a different namespace, you would use:
	Value for the relationship field is provided in a specific format: Fully Qualified Namespace . Resource Name <strong>?</strong>  Resource Identity  What character is used for ?
	There is 1 registry that manages all types of resources

56. Adding Validations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Resource: https://github.com/acloudfan/HLF-Course-Domain-Model/tree/master/airlinev5

	String regex=//
	Double, Long, Integer range=[lower-bound,upper-bound]

	QZ-25:
	You may code complex & dynamic business rules as part of the regex
	Complex business rules may be implemented in business logic for transactions instead of the field validations
	The regular expression for the field validation is enclosed by
	Keyword regex  applies to field of type:
	Keyword range  applies to field of type:

58. Modeling the Transactions:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Resource: https://github.com/acloudfan/HLF-Course-Domain-Model/tree/master/airlinev7

Transactions:
	- state changes of an asset
	- all transaction records in the ledger
	- transaction have unique id transactionId
	- transaction emits events
	
	
annotations are connects the model file
	The annotations have the information that connect this function to the CreateFlight transactions. Within

	the function you would use the composer API

	and then you would also emit the event which is defined in the model file.

	This is how the annotations looked like. The @param defines the parameter for the transaction.

	CreateFlight. This is a fully qualified reference to the transaction in the model.

	The flight data has all the attributes of fields defined as part of the transaction definition.
	
Historian
	Track the user and system related transactions
	track all successfull transactions
	
	qz-26:
	In a model Transactions are treated like a __________
	Like Asset  and Participants , you need to create the identity field for the transaction and associate it with transaction  using the Identified by  keyword
	The transaction code is written in ________
	These two fields are part of every transaction & are populated by the fabric automatically transactionId  timestamp
	Events are emitted by/from the ____________
	Like Transaction , the Event  does not require Identified by
	Events get assigned the timestamp  field automatically and it also has a field _____ that has a unique value
	____________ are used for associating model definition of the transaction  with the Javascript code for the transaction
	The transaction Javascript code execute the ____________
	Historian includes all types of transactions : system and user transactions
	
60. Queries:

	Named queries
		- Defined as part of the Business Network model
		-Exposed as RESRAPI by composer-rest-server
		
	Dynamic queries:
		- Constructed dynamically @ runntime
		
	Named queries:
	- All queries edined in a single file called queries.py
	- query {
		description: provide the description of the query
		statement: Using composer query language
	}
